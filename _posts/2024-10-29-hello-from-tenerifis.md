It's 20:22 server time and I'm sitting on the undock of the UALX-3 Keepstar. The river of capitals, freighters, and DSTs has slowed to a trickle, and it now seems as though we're moved in in earnest. Our alliance mates have scattered to the new regions we hold and have begun to construct their farms and fields as we wait for the next steps to be taken from alliance leadership.

Within [Illuminated](https://illuminatedcorp.com), we're not waiting for anything. We're living out of a network of POS's like it's 2009. I believe this is a rare opportunity to experience Eve life on the frontier, before there's at least a Fortizar in every dead end backwater system in our empire. It's a unique way to play the game, having to safelog an Orca that acts as a [Conestoga Wagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conestoga_wagon).

During this time, we've really been embracing the do-everything T3. I've specifically become a strong Proteus enjoyer during this time.
